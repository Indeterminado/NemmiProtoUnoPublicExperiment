# NemmiProtoUno Android App
In this section you can find the Android Studio project for the application used in the study of how users map mobile handheld device gestures to musical parameters.
It is a rather simple app, uses no external libraries, and should compile without problems. It implements functionalities for touch and accelerometer reading, as well as network communication (over UDP) and sensor data logging. Just open the **NemiProtoUno** folder with Android Studio and you should be good to go.

**DISCLAIMER:** although I did test this app on many devices, the nature of the Android ecosystem is such that it IS possible that a given device is unable to run this app. No guarantee is made regarding that, but feel free to adapt and correct it.

For details on how to use this application in the context of the experiment, check section [Experiment resources](https://github.com/Indeterminado/NemmiProtoUnoPublicExperiment/tree/main/Experiment%20resources "Experiment resources") of this repository.
